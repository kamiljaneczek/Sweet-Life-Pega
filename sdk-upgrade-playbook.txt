4	SDK Upgrade Playbook
Summary
This document outlines the steps to take to upgrade a connected SDK project and ensure
compatibility with Pega Infinity.
The number of changes required will vary from upgrade to upgrade and be dependent on
the customers upgrade frequency.
A degree of manual intervention is required based on the extent of customization.
Components which have been overwritten need to be checked for fundamental changes
which need to be integrated.

Upgrade steps
1. Take a copy of any repo specific configuration files e.g., sdk-config.json and
package.json.
2. Create a new upgrade branch from the desired branch. Could be “main” but could
also be the latest production branch. Name it so the purpose is clear:
git branch sdk-upgrade-24.2.0
3. Checkout the branch.
git checkout sdk-upgrade-24.2.0
| Use git checkout -b sdk-upgrade-24.2.0 command to create and checkout in one.
4. If the repo to be upgraded was cloned and not forked, add the original repo as a
remote:
git remote add upstream https://github.com/pegasystems/react-sdk.git
5. Fetch the latest changes from the upstream repo:
git fetch upstream
6. Merge changes from upstream branch into local branch:
git merge upstream/main --allow-unrelated-histories
| "main" is the branch from upstream we want merge. It might be preferable to merge a release branch
| The --allow-unrelated-histories flag enables git to merge histories that are unrelated, useful
if there is a detached fork from Pegasystems.
7. Resolve any merge conflicts. For example...

In this example, the sdk-config.json values backed up in step 1 where merged into
the sdk-config file.
| It's important that this file isn't added to the git repo - it should remain in local only but need to ensure
any changes to properties are accounted for.
With the package-lock.json file, the changes were ignored as step 9 will regenerate this
based on the changes to the package.json file.
There could be a variety of changes required as part of this stage, dependent on the
changes made since creation / last upgrade. Some examples include:
- Changes to linting rules
- Added/upgraded/removed dependency packages
- Linting/TypeScript errors. Whilst every effort is made to ensure the PCore /
PConnect Typescript definition library is kept up to date, there have been
instances where the type definitions do not meet the documentation, causing
errors to be thrown.

It’s also worth checked the release notes for the latest update.
8. Manually review and update changes to overridden components. The Out of the Box
SDK components are brought into the core SDK as a dependency library.
The components might be overridden in the project, meaning any of the latest Pega
changes may be missed.
The sdk-local-component-map.js file in the root directory will provide information
on what files have been overwritten as part of the project. These should be checked
for added/updated functionality and changes integrated into the component
override files.
As you can see in the above image, the number of overwritten files can grow over
time. They should be checked for fundamental changes in functionality.

| This is a key step and can be missed.
9. Clean and re-install node modules and refresh npm packages by running the
following command:
npm run build:dev:ci
10. Once any conflicts have been resolved, the changes can be committed to the branch:
git commit -m "Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/main' into sdk-upgrade-24.2.10"
11. Test. Test. And test some more.
Thoroughly test the code locally.
| Ensure the project is valid by pointing to a version of Pega Infinity that matches that of the SDK – in our
example here, 24.2.10
12. Once testing is complete and no further issues found, push the branch and any
changes to the repo:
git push origin sdk-upgrade-24.2.10
13. Create a pull request for merging these changes into main

| When raising the pull request, ensure the base is your forked repo and not the Pegasystems upstream
14. After review (if required) merge the changes either yourself or via your React Lead /
release manager.
15. Once successfully merged, the upgrade branch can be safely deleted

16. Ensure the list of remote branches is refreshed to reflect the deletion of the branch
git fetch --prune
17. Delete the branch from your local repo
18. Add a tag to ensure we can reference the upgrade snapshot
git tag -a sdk-upgrade-8.11.23 -m "Merged latest Pega core SDK changes"
| It is possible that the tag will already exist as part of the SDK merge. Verify tags with “git tag”

Process flow
In terms of process, the upgrade should be done just prior to the start or at the start of a
new sprint.
Ideally, regression testing should happen straight away.
Sprint work should be done against the new version to prevent potentially complex
merge conflicts.
